#~ "A snapshot provides a \"point-in-time\" image of the ZFS pool. In one way, "
#~ "this is similar to a full system backup as the snapshot contains the "
#~ "information for the entire filesystem. However, it has several advantages "
#~ "over a full backup. Snapshots occur instantaneously, meaning the filesystem "
#~ "does not need to be unmounted and you can continue to use applications on "
#~ "your system as the snapshot is created. Since snapshots contain the meta-"
#~ "data ZFS uses to access files, the snapshots themselves are small and "
#~ "subsequent snapshots only contain the changes that occurred since the last "
#~ "snapshot was taken. This space efficiency means you can take snapshots "
#~ "often. Snapshots also provide a convenient way to access previous versions "
#~ "of files as you can browse to the point-in-time for the version of the file "
#~ "you need. Life Preserver makes it easy to configure when snapshots are taken"
#~ " and provides a built-in graphical browser for finding and restoring the "
