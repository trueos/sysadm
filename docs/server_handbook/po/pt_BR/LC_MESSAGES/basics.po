"Back on the server, run :command:`sudo sysadm-binary bridge_add <nickname> "

"address (Example URL: 127.0.0.1:12149). If necessary, (re)start the server. "
"The log (:file:`/var/log/sysadm-server-ws.log`) will display messages about "
"connecting to the bridge. If properly configured, the server and bridge will"
" now be communicating with each other. At this point, clients can be added "
